All below exercise and observations are done on neo4j-3_0_3 community version.

##Prerequisites for production dataloading##

1. Allocate enough heap memory by modifying neo4j-wrapper.conf. Based on system configuration specify in range of 4000-16000 MB, Keep initial and max size same to avoid GC overhead. 
	
	dbms.memory.heap.initial_size=8000
	dbms.memory.heap.max_size=8000
	
2. Allocate enough pagecache by modifying below property in "/etc/neo4j/neo4j.conf"
	dbms.memory.pagecache.size=8g

Basically, system RAM should be divided and allocated by below thumb rule
	
	Total RAM = Heap Memory + PageCache + OS RAM (2-4 GB)

Example : In case of 16 GB RAM, allocate heap = 8 gb, pageCache = 6gb and 2 GB for OS. Read neo4j manual for memory tuning and more clarification.

3. Turn off logging if disk space is limited, as it will generate and keep lot of transaction logs
   Set below property in "/etc/neo4j/neo4j.conf" to false  
   
   dbms.tx_log.rotation.retention_policy=false
   
4. While starting neo4j server, make sure you should not get below warning "Neo4j WARNING: Max 1024 open files allowed, minimum of 40 000 recommended. See the Neo4j manual" 

In linux, run "ulimit -n" command to check how many files can be opened, if it is 1024 then change it to allow opening 40000 files.

Solution : http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20924596/neo4j-warning-max-1024-open-files-allowed-minimum-of-40-000-recommended-see-t

After changing "ulimit", restart neo4j server in new session.

5. With default configuration Neo4j only accepts local connections. To accept non-local connections, uncomment this line:

	dbms.connectors.default_listen_address=0.0.0.0

##Troubleshooting Input Data Loading##

Some CSV input files may be ill formed and crash a CSV input process. For example, embedded single (') or double quotes ("),
will cause problems. We need to replace that with single quote(') as neo4j csv loader will throw error on loading text 
with double quote ("). For example "semmeddb_concept.txt", "semmeddb_sentence.txt" and "semmeddb_sentence_predication.txt" contains (") which can be verified and replaced using below command.

Command :
	for checking 
			grep '\"' ./filename
	for replacing 
		sed -e -i "s/\"\'/g" ./filename

Alternately, the available Python script kb3_V5_preprocessor.py fixes this and other formatting rough edges to input data.

Now, follow DATALOADING_R3_README.md to run input CQL script(s)
		
##Post processing for production database##

1. Stop DB server.

2. Basically to scale up readability of this application, we need to have enough page cache and heap memory. According to neo4j documentation, pagecache should by 120 % of "*.neostore.*.db" size (check content under neoInstalllocation/data/databases/graph.db/)
Our *.neostore.*.db is  approx. 100 GB, so allocated 120 GB of pagecache by modifying below property in "neo4j.conf" file.

	dbms.memory.pagecache.size=120g

3. To support multiple concurrent user, allocate minimum of 16 gb of heap memory by modifying below properties in "neo4j-wrapper.conf"

 	dbms.memory.heap.initial_size=16000
	dbms.memory.heap.max_size=16000
	
4. Start DB server.

3. First, warm up page cache by running below neo4j query as it will bring all neo4j nodes, relations and properties in RAM and make subsequent queries faster.

	MATCH (n)
	OPTIONAL MATCH (n)-[r]->()
	RETURN count(n) + count(r);
